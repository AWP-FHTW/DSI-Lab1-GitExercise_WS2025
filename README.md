## Git Exercise Repository

Welcome!  
This repository is a sandbox to practice the basic Git workflow of **fork → branch → change → pull request**.

## Task

1. **Fork** this repository into your own GitHub account.  
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.  
3. Create a **new branch** with your name, e.g. `my-name-branch`.  
4. Open this file (`README.md`).  
5. Scroll down to the **Participants** section below.  
6. Add your entry in **alphabetical order** following the required format.  
7. **Commit** your change with a meaningful commit message.  
8. **Push** your branch to your forked repository.  
9. Open a **Pull Request** (PR) to the original repository.

## Entry format

Your entry should maintain alphabetical order and use this format:

```
* Your Name, Student ID, [username](https://github.com/username)
```
